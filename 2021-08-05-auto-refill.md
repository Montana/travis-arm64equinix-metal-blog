## Whatâ€™s new?

Travis CI released usage-based pricing late last year, which allows customers to run as many resources they want, all at the same time while paying for the infrastructure they actually use (in the form of credits).

In an effort to provide Travis CI users with even more control, we are happy to announce a new Credit Auto-Refill feature. This feature allows users to automatically replenish their accounts with a set amount of credits each time their balance gets below a set refill threshold. This feature will give Travis CI users a more seamless experience (no more running out of credits), while also giving users greater control over their accounts.

## How will this feature work? 

The user can enable or disable the auto-refill feature at any time. New users will have the feature enabled by default, while existing users will need to enable it themselves. To enable auto-refill, go to: [Settings -> Plan tab](https://travis-ci.com/account/plan) -> scroll down to Credits section -> Credits tab.


The auto-refill feature is available to all users who provide their credit card information and enroll in a usage-based plan or purchase credit add-ons under a concurrency plan. This feature is not available to Free Plan users.

For more details about how auto-refill works in your usage-based or concurrency-based plan, please read our [documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/billing-Autorefill/).

## When will this feature be released?

The auto-refill feature is available starting today, 05 of August 2021 on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com).

As always, if you have any questions or issues with the new Auto-refill feature, please email support@travis-ci.com for help.
